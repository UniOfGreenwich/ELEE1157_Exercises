# Application Layer

In this simulation activity is intended to provide a foundation for understanding TCP and UDP in detail. Packet Tracer simulation mode provides the ability to view the state of different PDUs as they travel through the network.

Packet Tracer Simulation mode enables you to view each protocol and the associated PDUs. The steps outlined below guide you through the process of requesting network services using various applications available on a client PC. You will explore the functionality of the TCP and UDP protocols, multiplexing, and the function of port numbers in determining which local application requested or is sending the data. Note that Packet Tracer will not score this activity.
